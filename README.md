## Testing
### curl commands

#### Register a new user
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user1","password":"password"}'
```

#### Login to get JWT token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user1","password":"password"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "token": "your-jwt-token-here"
}
```

#### Send a message (use the preiously obtained JWT token)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token-here" \
  -d '{"receiver_id":"user2","content":"Hello, user2!"}'
```

Expected result:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

#### Get messages
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token-here"
```

Response:
```json
[
  {
    "ID": "some-uuid",
    "SenderID": "user1",

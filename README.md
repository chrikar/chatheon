## Developer setup
To set up pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting, install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Then, you can run the pre-commit hooks manually with:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Makefile commands
The Makefile provides a convenient way to run common tasks. Here are some of the commands you can use:

### Build the application
```bash
make build
```

### Run the application
```bash
make run
```

### Run unit tests
```bash
make test
```

### Check test coverage
```bash
make coverage
```

### Build and run locally
```bash
make build
make run
```

### Run with Docker
```bash
make docker-up
```

### Stop Docker services
```bash
make docker-down
```

### Run linter
```bash
make lint
```

## Features

- âœ… Hexagonal architecture (ports & adapters)
- âœ… JWT authentication
- âœ… User registration & login
- âœ… Full unit test coverage with GitHub Actions CI
- âœ… Test coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- âœ… Clean, idiomatic Go project structure
- âœ… Dockerized development environment

## Roadmap

- ðŸ”’ Secure endpoints with JWT middleware (âœ… done)
- ðŸ’¬ Add messaging service
- ðŸ“¦ Persist messages to database
- ðŸš€ Add WebSocket support
- ðŸ§© Extend to conversations and channels
- ðŸ§© Improve CI with coverage thresholds

## Testing
### curl commands

#### Register a new user
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user1","password":"password"}'
```

#### Login to get JWT token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user1","password":"password"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "token": "your-jwt-token-here"
}
```

#### Send a message (use the preiously obtained JWT token)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token-here" \
  -d '{"receiver_id":"user2","content":"Hello, user2!"}'
```

Expected result:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

#### Get messages
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token-here"
```

#### Get messages with pagination
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/messages?limit=5&offset=0" -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

Response:
```json
[
  {
    "ID": "some-uuid",
    "SenderID": "user1",
    "ReceiverID": "user2",
    "Content": "Hello, user2!"
  }
]
```
